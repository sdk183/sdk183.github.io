<h4> My Review </h4>
<p style="font-size:16px;"> The restauarnt wasn't the cleanest nor the prettiest, but to be fair, the building was old and worn down. I went around 9pm 
after I finished my night classes. I ordered three al pastor tacos, got some sides like cilantro, onions, and sauces. There were three types of sauces a regular verde sauce, a red spicy sauce, and 
an avocado sauce, I got the verde and the red spicy sauce and they were not as spicy as I would have like them to be. The meat was very chewy and not 
as tender but it was juicy, though it was almost closing time and they had probably made fresh al pastor since the dinner time. The corn tortilla was soggy, but held the meat pretty well which was nice. 
I enjoyed the food, but if I was going to get tacos I would rather go to La Salsa Verde, read my review!, than come back here. Though it was 
not bad, it wasn't as great as the other restauarnts that sell tacos.</p>
<h5> My rating: 3.5/5 </h5>
