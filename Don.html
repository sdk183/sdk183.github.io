      <p class="w3-large w3-center">Don Tacos is a Mexican restaurant that serves tacos and other mexican cuisines. I came across this 
        restaurant when I was looking around for local restaurants that sell tacos near me. It's not the cleanest restauarnt as the building 
        is old and worn down, but the food was decent and at a decent price point.

<h4> My Review </h4>
<p style="font-size:16px;"> The restauarnt wasn't the cleanest nor the prettiest, but to be fair, the building was old and worn down. I went around 9pm 
after I finished my night classes. I ordered three al pastor tacos, got some sides like cilantro, onions, and sauces. The sauces weren't the spiciest, 
and the meat was very chewy and not as tender, though it was almost closing time. The corn tortilla was soggy, but held the meat pretty well.</p>
<h5> My rating: 3.5/5 </h5>
