<!--My review and rating-->
<h4> My Review </h4>
<p style="font-size:16px;"> When I visited the restaurant, it was clean and fairly empty, since I had visited after the lunch times. I ordered the teriyaki chicken and it took about 7 minutes to get my order. My order came with a side of rice, mac and cheese, the teriyaki chicken, some sauce, and an eggroll. The rice, mac and cheese, and eggroll were all pretty standard, nothing good or bad to note about. The sauce was a sweet and a bit spicy teriyaki sauce, as it had some hints of wasabi mixed into it. My honest opinion about the sauce is that its not the greatest since I don't enjoy wasabi, and I usually like to have a sweet teriyaki sauce instead of a sweet and spicy sauce. The teriyaki was juicy, tender, and flavorful. It was a good meal for a decent price, about $12.</p>
<h5> My rating: 4.4/5 </h5>
