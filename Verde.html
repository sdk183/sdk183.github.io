<!--My review and rating-->
<h4> My Review </h4>
<p style="font-size:16px;"> When I visited the restaurant, it was clean and very busy. I had visited on a Sunday during lunch time and
     the place was packed with no spaces for seating, which is a good thing, because that signifies that the restaurant is popular and 
     people are willing to wait for their food even if it is packed. I ordered four al pastor street tacos from the menu and it costs 
     aroudn $10. It came with some chopped onions, cilantro, lime, a slice of radish, and salsa. There are two types of salsa, the 
     verde, green salsa, which was a bit spicy and sour. The other salsa was the red salsa, which was extemely spicy, but very flavorful.
    The al pastor was juicy and cooked all the way through, and the corn tortilla was a bit soggy, but firm enough to hold all the 
    ingredients. The food was truely amazing and the restaurant became my togo spot for street tacos.</p>
<h5> My rating: 5/5 </h5>
